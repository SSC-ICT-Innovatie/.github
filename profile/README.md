## Why SSC-ICT is embracing Working in the Open

1. Enhanced Collaboration and Networking
Working in the open fosters collaboration and networking by breaking down hierarchical barriers. It allows SSC-ICT to connect with other professionals and stakeholders who share their interest in their work, leading to valuable insights and potential partnerships.

2. Increased Transparency
Digital services are dynamic and can vary significantly among users. By adopting open practices, SSC-ICT can provide transparency in how digital services are developed and delivered, enhancing accountability and trust.

3. Improved Institutional Memory
Documenting work openly helps new team members quickly understand past decisions and projects. It also allows external parties to see the rationale behind decisions, facilitating continuity and learning.

4. Accountability in Public Spending
Open working practices make it clear how public funds are being utilized in digital projects. This transparency ensures that public money is spent effectively and efficiently, fostering trust with stakeholders and the public.

5. Building Trust and Credibility
Lack of information can lead to misconceptions and doubts about digital services. By being open about processes and decisions, SSC-ICT can build trust and credibility with users and stakeholders.

6. Sharing Knowledge and Best Practices
Other teams and organizations may benefit from SSC-ICT’s experiences and solutions. Sharing methodologies and outcomes openly helps others avoid reinventing the wheel and promotes a culture of generosity and mutual support.
Patterns for Working in the Open

Public Show and Tells
Examples: Southwark Council’s affordable home monitoring and NHS 111’s urgent care team. Public presentations and demos of ongoing projects can keep stakeholders informed and engaged.

Project or Team Websites
Examples: MHCLG’s Digital Land and NHS Digital’s UEC Digital Services. Dedicated websites can host information about project goals, progress, and outcomes.

Design Histories
Example: Department for Education’s design history for becoming a teacher. Documenting design decisions and changes over time provides a comprehensive view of project evolution.

## Open Source Code
Maintaining repositories of government software on platforms like GitHub allows for community contributions and external review, enhancing the quality and security of code.

By adopting these open practices, SSC-ICT can improve collaboration, transparency, and accountability, leading to better digital public services and stronger stakeholder relationships.
